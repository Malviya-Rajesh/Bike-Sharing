## General Information
- This project aims to analyze and predict bike-sharing demand using linear regression techniques.
- **Background**: Bike-sharing systems have become popular in urban areas as an eco-friendly mode of transportation. Understanding and predicting demand can help in optimizing bike distribution and availability.
- **Business Problem**: The main problem addressed by this project is predicting the number of bikes rented at a given time, which helps in operational decisions such as rebalancing the bike stations.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the "Bike Sharing Dataset". It includes information on hourly bike rental counts in the Capital Bikeshare system with corresponding weather and seasonal information.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - version 3.10
- **Pandas** - version 2.2.1
- **NumPy** - version 1.26.4
- **Matplotlib** - version 3.8.4
- **Seaborn** - version 0.13.2
- **Statmodels** - version 0.14.2
- **Scikit-learn** - version 1.4.2

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1**: Temperature has a significant positive correlation with the number of bike rentals. As the temperature increases, the number of rentals tends to increase.
- **Conclusion 2**: Weather conditions play a crucial role in bike sharing demand. Clearer weather leads to higher bike usage compared to rainy or snowy conditions.
- **Conclusion 3**: The linear regression model developed provides a reasonably good prediction of bike sharing demand with an R2 score of 0.82, though it could be further improved with additional features or more sophisticated modelling techniques.
